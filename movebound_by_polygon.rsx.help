{"ALG_DESC": "The function provides the facility to calculate the least-cost corridor between point locations. It just requires an input DTM and at least two point locations ('SpatialPointsDataFrame' class) representing the locations between which the corridor is calculated. Under the hood, 'movecorr' relies on the movecost function and, needless to say, implements the same cost functions. See the help documentation of movecost for further details. .\n\n", "ALG_CREATOR": "Gianmarco Alberti","ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Enzo Cocca adArte srl",  "Area_of_interest":"Polygon (SpatialPolygonDataFrame class) representing the study area for which online elevation data are aquired.
